        "story" : "The jungle hums with life — birds call through the trees, insects buzz unseen, and a soft breeze carries something strange… like a whisper. Aurora pushes aside a curtain of thick vines. She’s brave, curious, and always ready for a new mystery. Today, the mystery is deeper than ever. Behind her is Rick, her best friend — quick-witted, a little sarcastic, but always dependable. He checks their map, eyes locked on the strange swirling symbol marked in faded ink. Dog trots ahead, tail wagging. He’s loyal, smart, and has a nose for hidden things. Right now, that nose is pulling him toward something just out of sight. Aurora: “Alright team… let’s find out what the jungle is trying to tell us.” They reach a small clearing. Three paths lie ahead, each calling to them in a different way.",
