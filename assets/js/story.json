Aurora pushes aside a curtain of thick vines. She’s brave, curious, and always ready for a new mystery. Today, the mystery is deeper than ever. Behind her is Rick, her best friend — quick-witted, a little sarcastic, but always dependable. He checks their map, eyes locked on the strange swirling symbol marked in faded ink. Dog trots ahead, tail wagging. He’s loyal, smart, and has a nose for hidden things. Right now, that nose is pulling him toward something just out of sight. Aurora: “Alright team… let’s find out what the jungle is trying to tell us.” They reach a small clearing. Three paths lie ahead, each calling to them in a different way.",

Aurora: “The jungle just answered us.” They step onto the newly revealed path and face an ancient stone arch etched with the same swirl. A distant whisper hums in their minds, as though the jungle itself speaks to them. Aurora: “We’re not alone.”"},

Rick: “Something’s guiding us.”They step onto the newly revealed path and face an ancient stone arch etched with the same swirl.
